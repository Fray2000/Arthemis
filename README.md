Raspberry PI Home brain

The Arthemis project is ment for students or persons with limited possibilities to deploy home informatic infrastructure.

It's main objectives are to have a compact home server that can offer many features in a beautiful packaging. The tageted use is to have one computer that manages tasks that would be usually managed by many different devices such as a router or a a NAS server. It's use of mainstream components make the Arthemis system very effective, afforable, and very flexible and many devices can be added to the overall system. 
It's open source source makes it's improvements totally free and the server have a much longer lifetime. The use of a Raspberry pi makes it a perfect fit for such use if possible, the suuport of other boards will be added with time. The removal of the SD Card by using the USB boot feature added in the latest Raspberry's makes the computer much more durable since more durable memories than SD cards can be used for running the system. It's low power consomption and adjustable CPU frequency makes it able to enter economy mode that will be used for the power efficiency of the entirety system. 
The system is also more ecologycal beceause of the use of only one board and it's flexibility promisses a much longer lifetime that usual comperable devices.

The projects offers:
                  - A 3D printed base that supports 2.5 drives and the Raspberry Pi 2 / 3 (all versions included with B and B+ varients)
                  - software ?
